Recursion:
When a function calls itself or another function.

There are 4 types of recursion.
1. Tail Recusion: When recursion comes in the end of a function.
2. Head Recusion: when recursion comes in the head of a function.
3. Tree Recusion: when a function calls itself more than once.
4. Indirect Recusion: when there are more than one function they call itself in a loop.
